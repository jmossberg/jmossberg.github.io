ARM Cortex M3 documentation is available on different levels of detail:

* __Olimex__ sell ARM based development boards based on among others STMMicroelectronics devices. They provide documentation for their development boards. The documentation focus on what components are included on the development board and how they fit together.
* __STMicroelectronics__ manufacture and sell ARM based microcontrollers. They provide detailed documentation for their devices, but they may leave some information out that is generic for all ARM based devices.
* __ARM Holdings__ provide detailed documentation regarding the ARM processor core and the underlying ARM architecture which the processor is based on. They do not manufacture devices themselves. Instead they sell licenses to other companies such as STMicroelectronics.

## Development Board (STM32-H103)

Documentation about the STM32-H103 development board is available from Olimex and other companies selling Olimex products.
