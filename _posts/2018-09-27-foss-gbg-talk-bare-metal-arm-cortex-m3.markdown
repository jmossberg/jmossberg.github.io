I gave a talk at [Foss-gbg](http://foss-gbg.se) yesterday about [Running C programs bare metal on ARM using the GNU toolchain](http://foss-gbg.se/2018/09/foss-gbg-2018-09-running-c-programs-bare-metal-on-arm-using-the-gnu-toolchain/). The talk was based on two of my blog posts:

* [Run a minimalistic program written in assembler on STM32-H103 development board]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-10-minimalistic-assembler-program-on-stm32-h103 %})
* [Run a C program bare metal on an ARM Cortex M3]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-11-run-c-program-bare-metal-on-arm-cortex-m3 %})
