Description of the STM32F10X standard peripheral libarary from its documentation:

> The STM32F10x Standard Peripherals Library is a complete package,
> consisting of device drivers for all of the standard device peripherals,
> for STM32 Value line(High, Medium and Low), Connectivity line, XL-,
> High-, Medium- and Low- Density Devices 32-bit Flash microcontrollers. 
>
> This library is a firmware package which contains a collection of routines,
> data structures and macros covering the features of STM32 peripherals. It
> includes a description of the device drivers plus a set of examples for
> each peripheral. The firmware library allows any device to be used in
> the user application without the need for in-depth study of each peripheralâ€™s
> specifications. 
>
> Using the Standard Peripherals Library has two advantages: it saves
> significant time that would otherwise be spent in coding, while simultaneously
> reducing application development and integration costs. 
> The STM32F10x Standard Peripherals Library is full CMSIS compliant.
