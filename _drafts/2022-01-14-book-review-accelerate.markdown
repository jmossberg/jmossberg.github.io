title: Book review: Accelerate (Nicole Forsgren PhD, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim) 
---

The book Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim outlines multiple aspects of successful software development 

Lead time
Deployment Frequency
Mean time to restore (MTTR)
Change fail percentage

The call it "capabilities" in the book.


What is maybe missing that I'm interested to know more about.
* Ability for a developer in an organization to get end to end system understanding
* Access to logs and source code outside her/his immediate domain
